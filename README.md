## One Sentence Summary:
We worked as a group to figure out the Pittsburgh neighborhood that would be the best to commit crimes in by using the Python libraries: "Pandas", "MatPlotLib", and "numPy". We looked for which neighborhoods had the most hiding spots, and least chance to be caught while committing a crime.
